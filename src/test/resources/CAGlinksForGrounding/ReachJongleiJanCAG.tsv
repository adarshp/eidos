At the same time, crop production was further hindered by a lack of agricutural inputs, with only 30% of assessed settlements in January reporting that agricultural inputs were available, compared to 41% in December.	ssd_situation_overview_jonglei_state_january_2017_final	text		lack of agricultural inputs			crop production				hindered by	negative						in January	January 2017	January 2017				
Moreover, 37% of assessed settlements reported that most of the farming tools and assets in the community had been looted or abandoned, hindering populations to continue to conduct livelihoods activities, or, for those returning from displacement, restart them.	ssd_situation_overview_jonglei_state_january_2017_final	text		assets in the community had been looted or abandoned			conduct livelihoods activities				hindering	negative

Access to food was also restricted by populations’ limited ability to source food from markets.	ssd_situation_overview_jonglei_state_january_2017_final	text		limited ability to source food from markets			Access to food				restricted by	negative												
Although 61% of assessed settlements reported access to a functioning market, only  8%  relied  on  markets  as  main  food  source.  This  is  likely  attributable  to  the  high  costs  of  food  items,  as  the  vast  majority  of  settlements  reported  that  common  goods  such as sorghum, sugar and vegetable oil were available but had risen in cost since December. 	ssd_situation_overview_jonglei_state_january_2017_final	text		the high costs of food items			only 8% relied on markets as main food source				likely attributable to													
As a result of these factors undermining food security, populations in settlements assessed reportedly increasingly resort to more extreme coping mechanisms to deal with a lack of food.	ssd_situation_overview_jonglei_state_january_2017_final	text		factors undermining food security			more extreme coping mechanisms to deal with a lack of food														settlements assessed	settlements assessed	settlements assessed
